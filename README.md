Personal Portfolio Website
As a beginner web developer, I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects using HTML and CSS. The project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in web design while providing a professional platform to introduce myself. The website includes a clear, visually appealing layout with an introductory image, my contact information, and a section to showcase my skills, experience, and achievements.
